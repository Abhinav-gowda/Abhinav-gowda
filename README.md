# 👋 Aspiring Data Analyst

You may call me **Abhinav**, a **BCA (Artificial Intelligence) student** who enjoys working with **data, logic, and systems that make sense** — not just dashboards that look good.

I like exploring how **raw data turns into decisions**. I’m curious about patterns, careful with numbers, and obsessed with understanding **_why_ something works — not just _that_ it works**.

When I’m not working with data, I explore tech, improve my coding skills, and experiment with small ideas that help me learn better.

> **Fun Fact:** I enjoy breaking things just to understand how to fix them again.

## 🧠 How I Think

I enjoy turning  

> **“The data says this”**  
into  
> **“This insight actually helps someone decide.”**

I value:
- clarity over complexity  
- logic over hype  
- learning over pretending to know everything

## 🧩 What I Say I Do

- Analyze data  
- Write Python & SQL  
- Build small systems to understand big problems  
- Debug code that was *“working perfectly yesterday”*  
- Learn AI concepts one step at a time  

---

## 🔍 What I Actually Focus On

### 📊 Data Analysis Mindset
- Cleaning messy data before trusting it  
- Understanding trends, not just plotting graphs  
- Asking the right questions before running models  
- Making outputs readable for **humans**, not just machines  

### ⚙️ System Thinking *(Beginner, but serious)*
- How data flows through an application  
- How backend logic affects analysis  
- How poor data design leads to wrong insights

## 🛠️ Tech I Work With

### Languages & Tools
- **Python**
- **SQL (MySQL)**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- **Flask** (basic backend understanding)
- **Java, C**

### Concepts
- Data Cleaning & Analysis  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Database Design  
- CRUD Operations  
- Problem Solving

## 📘 Things I’ve Learned Along the Way

- Clean data matters more than complex models  
- Small, correct logic beats big, confusing code  
- Understanding fundamentals saves hours of debugging  
- AI is powerful — but only when the data is honest  

---

## 🤖 How I Think About Data & AI

- Fancy models don’t fix bad data  
- If you can’t explain the insight, it’s not useful  
- *“It works”* means nothing without *“it’s reliable”*  
- Learning deeply beats learning fast
